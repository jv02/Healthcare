# Healthcare

Our solution to centralize the healthcare system is use of E-Medical Cards. Public in India is already using Aadhar card as per mandate, so it would be more viable to just extend the use of Aadhar cardâ€™s unique Identity for E-Medical Cards. As such the medical cards proposed by us are using Aadhar number as unique identity number. 
To make it a practical use we have implemented it on a web application.
Doctors: Can view as well as alter patients medical conditions, as well as get patients medical history without traditional file systems.
Patients:Can view their profile and past records as well as they no longer need to carry their medical files when visiting a new doctor.
Along with this we have also implemented spatial view of Ahemdabad city. In this view person can see which disease is more prominent in which sectors as well as government can find sectors needing more medical attention. Apart from this people can also view the prediction of dieses over a course of time. All this is done only on Ahemdabad district. As per screens shots the regions with higher concentration of red hue has more cases of certain diseases then whiter ones.
